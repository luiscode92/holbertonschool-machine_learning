# 0x00. Pandas
## Specializations > Machine Learning > The Pipeline
## Objectives
* What is `pandas`?
* What is a `pd.DataFrame`? How do you create one?
* What is a `pd.Series`? How do you create one?
* How to load data from a file
* How to perform indexing on a `pd.DataFrame`
* How to use hierarchical indexing with a `pd.DataFrame`
* How to slice a `pd.DataFrame`
* How to reassign columns
* How to sort a `pd.DataFrame`
* How to use boolean logic with a `pd.DataFrame`
* How to merge/concatenate/join `pd.DataFrames`
* How to get statistical information from a `pd.DataFrame`
* How to visualize a `pd.DataFrame`
## Requirements
* Your files will be executed with `numpy` (version 1.15) and `pandas` (version 0.24)
* Unless otherwise noted, you can only use `import pandas as pd`
## Datasets
* `coinbase` and `bitstamp` datasets, as seen previously in `0x0E. Time Series Forecasting`
