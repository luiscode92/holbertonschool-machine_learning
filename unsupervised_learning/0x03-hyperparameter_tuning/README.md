# 0x03. Hyperparameter Tuning
## Specializations - Machine Learning â€• Unsupervised Learning
## Objectives
* What is Hyperparameter Tuning?
* What is random search? grid search?
* What is a Gaussian Process?
* What is a mean function?
* What is a Kernel function?
* What is Gaussian Process Regression/Kriging?
* What is Bayesian Optimization?
* What is an Acquisition function?
* What is Expected Improvement?
* What is Knowledge Gradient?
* What is Entropy Search/Predictive Entropy Search?
* What is GPy?
* What is GPyOpt?

## Requirements
* Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.4), but can ignore error `E741`
* Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module except `import numpy as np`
