# 0x03. Policy Gradients
## Specializations > Machine Learning > Reinforcement Learning
In this project, you will implement your own Policy Gradient in your loop of reinforcement learning (by using the Monte-Carlo policy gradient algorithm - also called `REINFORCE`).
## Objectives
* What is Policy?
* How to calculate a Policy Gradient?
* What and how to use a Monte-Carlo policy gradient?
## Tasks
0. Simple Policy function

1. Compute the Monte-Carlo policy gradient

2. Implement the training

3. Animate iteration
